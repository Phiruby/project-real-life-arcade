Below is an image of what the game may look like.

In the above example, the **black square represents our head**. Since the text says "Dodge to the left", we have to move our heads to the left side of the screen to survive.

The circles represent our gun pointer. To point the gun, simply point your finger at the screen. To fire the gun, move your middle finger as if you were pulling the trigger of a gun. You will know that you fired the gun if the circle turns red. 
**Note that you can use both your fingers in the game**

To kill the bats, make sure your pointers are above the bat, and you pull the trigger of your imaginary gun.

That's it! Follow the instructions and kill as many bats as you can to win the game!
